            <ul class="bullet_points">
              <li class="bullet_header">Set goals for yourself</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>They can be small and easily accomplishable or large and long-term.
                    When working towards your goal, be sure to focus on your strenghts, solve a problem, and focus on the future 
                    instead of the past. It's a good idea to think of the smaller steps that lead to the goal. Congratulate yourself
                    for accomplishing those small tasks because doing so is a sign of achievement!</li>
                <br>
                    <li> When thinking about goals for your recovery, it's important that you
                    consider things that motivate you or bring you joy. Think about the direction you want to take in your life. 
                    Having a deep investment in the goals that you set will increase the chances of completing them. </li>
                <br>
                    <li>Once you have set goals for yourself, try to igure out what things are necessary to accomplish those goals.
                    Why did you set this goal and how will your life be different once this goal is achieved?
                    Consider your strengths and skills that will help you achieve your goal. 
                    Try to involve necessary support systems and resources that can help you through the process
                    if and when you need it. Finally, remember to stay focused on the goal and not on the difficulties
                    you might be having. Keep an open mind, and know that you may hit barriers along the way.
                    Recovery is no easy task, and focusing on the negative experiences will only make things harder.</li>
                </ul>
              <li class="bullet_header"><strong>Care for yourself</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's very important to take care of yourself as you recover. People in recovery find that their physical, spiritual, and emotional health 
                        are all connected, and doing well in one area leads to better wellness in other areas. Try to do things like meditate, doing yoga,
                        sleep well, eat healthy and exercise. Also, it's a good idea to practice good hygiene. This is important for social, medical, and psychological reasons.
                        Seeing friends will improve your emotional being as it will improve your sense of inclusiveness. 
                        Consider joining a support group to make new friends.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="bullet_header"> <strong>Create Joy and Satification</strong> </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Living with a mental health condition can be taxing emotionally, physically, and mentally. 
                Experts have found that good feelings can boost your ability to deal with stress, solve problems, 
                think flexibly, and even fight disease. Taking care of your body emotionally, physically, 
                and mentally through creating joy and satisfaction is an important part of living with or without a 
                mental health condition. Studies show that laughing decreases pain, may help your heart and lungs, promotes muscle relaxation, and can reduce anxiety.
                Positive emotions can decrease stress hormones and build emotional strength.
                Leisure activities offer a distraction from problems, a sense of competence and many other benefits. 
                For example, in one study observing twins, the one who participated in leisure activities was less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease or dementia than their fellow twin.</li>
                </ul>
          <li class="bullet_header"> <strong>Connect with your friends, others, and a community</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    It is important that you check in with yourself periodically. If you do not then you may not realize 
                    that things are changing or getting out of control. Checking in with yourself allows you the opportunity 
                    to evaluate where you are in your recovery. You may find that you need to readjust what step of your action 
                    plan you are on or try different coping tools. If you have had low times in the past you understand how hard it 
                    can be to get out of those places. Learning all that you can about your mental health condition will help let you 
                    know that your hard times are not your fault. Making a list of accomplishments that you have achieved is a good resource 
                    to turn back to when you are feeling low. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>
                    Another tool that may help you is to journal about your experiences. 
                    Keeping a journal is a great way to learn about yourself. Being completely honest in your journal is important; 
                    in your journal, you should feel free to let your guard down. This will help you discover how you really feel and 
                    vent your stress in a non-threatening manner. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>
                    Another method of connecting with yourself is to become an 
                    advocate and share your story. There has been a lot of research that explores the power of storytelling as a form of 
                    therapy. Sharing your own experiences through writing or talking is an important stage of recovery. Just as you are 
                    supported by reading the thoughts and experiences of others you can also be the person that helps lift another.</li>
                <li>
                    Spending time with positive, loving people you care about and trust can ease stress, 
                    help your mood and improve the way you feel overall. They may be family members, close friends, members of a support 
                    group or a peer counselor at the local drop-in center. Many communities even have warmlines (free hotlines run by people 
                    with mental health conditions) that you can call to talk to someone and receive peer support.
                    Research points to the benefits of social connection: </li>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                <li>
                    Increased happiness. In one compelling study, a key difference between very happy people and less happy people was good relationships.
                   <li> Better health. Loneliness was associated with a higher risk of high blood pressure in a recent study of older people.
                    A longer life. People with strong social and community ties were two or three times less likely to die during a 9-year study.

                    Concrete help, such as having a friend pick your kids up from school;
                    Emotional support, like hearing someone say, "I'm really sorry you're having such a tough time";
                    Perspective, like being reminded that even the moodiest teenagers grow up;
                    Advice, such as a suggestion to plan a weekly date with your spouse;
                    Validation, like learning that other folks love reading train schedules too.
                    Do you have enough support? Ask yourself if you have at least a few friends or family members who: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You feel comfortable to be with;</li>
                        <li>Give you a sense that you could tell them anything;</li>
                        <li>Can help you solve problems;</li>
                        <li>Make you feel valued;</li>
                        <li>Take your concerns seriously.</li>
                    </ul>  
                </ul>
